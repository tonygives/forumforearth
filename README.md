Forum For Earth -- Education Initiative Repo

Bridging to Inclusive & Decentralised Futures

The Forum for Earth is an interdisciplinary education and changemaking initiative, born out of radical collaboration between a broad coalition of law, policy, public administration, technology, data governance, activist, arts, ecology, humanitarian and scientific ecosystems, organizations, and individual leaders.

The Forum comprises three key aspects:
 
1) Gather - a series of interdisciplinary gatherings. Researchers and project-developers present and spark discussion at the intersections of their work, from law and public administration, to social activism, finance, data governance, and data-driven technology infrastructure (e.g. A.I., IoT, and blockchain). The series offers a welcome to a network of peers gathering to co-create innovative and inclusive approaches to collective management of local and global common risks and resources.
 
2) Envision - a collective sensemaking space. Accessible to the general public, presentations and discussions from the gatherings are streamed, alongside videos, digital art, and projects from the lab network. It’s also a space that facilitates identity exploration & expression for individuals.

3) Act - an impact lab network. Communities of artists and blockchain developers are experimenting with new ways of connecting their work to social activism and civic engagement around local and global sustainability and regeneration projects. The network will develop re-usable digital infrastructure for local solidarities and civic resource banks, and nurture bridges between the data, stories, meaning, and measurable impact woven from these collective efforts to address the crises at hand.

This Education Initiative Repo will be an open source, freely accessible, repository of key reports, mixed-media, code, and template legal documentation and apps, drawn and curated from the various aspects of the Forum.

The first set of outputs will relate to outputs from the previous gathering held in October 2021, in Milan, alongside the pre-COP meetings, covering the following topics:


<< Collective Imagining towards New Economic Models of Value >>
The current dominant systems for measuring and producing social value are out of date. Markets can be hugely powerful tools of innovation but thus far, only for innovation that produces monetizable value.

At the same time, the decoupling of wellbeing from material wealth past certain thresholds has demonstrated the huge importance of non-material value creation as a focus of governance.

What can value frameworks from the world of art teach us about other value frameworks such as environmental protection or community cohesion, to mobilise resources towards their greatest potential for welfare.?
How might we enable collaborations between artists, data scientists, technologists, and governance professionals to support the collective development of these value frameworks, marshalling markets to foster innovation.
What role can these collaborations play in collective imagining towards greater awareness and emotional resonance with issues such as climate change and biodiversity loss?

<< The Rights of Nature >>

To what extent can we conceive of the rights of nature, or environmental rights, as fundamental rights? How can technology help implement them? What are the risks and challenges in doing so?

How can we develop open-source protocols and applications that enable the agency of non-human organisms to act in their own interest and to produce value in their own right, and go beyond common approaches towards sustainability and break the mantra of human domination over ‘nature’?

Why are some corporations seeking to appoint rivers and forests as members of their governing boards?

What does it look like for a forest to represent itself in legal actions against entities harming it?

<< Green New Deals: Climate Data Policy, Deep ESG Finance, and Interoperability for Polycentric Governance >>

Legislators and regulators in political and financial institutions around the world are considering various ‘Green New Deals’ alongside policies and compliance frameworks governing ESG reporting standards.

What are effective pathways for regulation and governance to manage the dynamics related to AI in implementing environmental objectives?
Is the path taken by the EU within the environmental and legislative sector a good one?
Can data governance and data regulations at all levels help to ensure that relevant AI systems make their decisions in accordance with principles of an ecological common good?

<< Citizen Sovereignty, Algorithmic Transparency, and Data Dignity for Equitable Planetary Governance >>

How can individual citizens benefit from new ecosystems of legal protections and tools focused on ‘data dignity’ that can support them in managing and maintaining sovereignty over their data?

How do tools, frameworks, and policies around algorithmic transparency combine to support greater choice and agency for citizens and communities in choosing services and products that support ecological and planetary health?

What are the potential ways in which these new ecosystems can support data governance frameworks that empower citizens to direct their attention and resources to new economic value frameworks that they align with, such as climate action.

<< Blockchain Standards and Frameworks for Impact >>

NFTs (non-fungible tokens) represent a developing standard of smart contracts within blockchain systems, which have caught the attention of the art world through their capacity to represent rights and value in relation to digital artworks.

A range of problems with current frameworks have been identified and we will be discussing proposals for new legal standards to support governance systems for new ways of representing value, with a focus on artistic and creative collaboration, as well as royalty distribution and remuneration rights models.

Further, NFTs, DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) and smart contracts are being developed for use in MRV (Measurement, Reporting and Verification) frameworks related to impact.

These have the potential to be integrated into a wider ecosystem of decentralized systems, including for oracles, data interoperability and retroactive public goods funding around climate projects.

How do we govern these systems, and what are the effects of an increased use of AI systems on the natural environment and developments such as anthropogenic climate change?
